This is an experimental and educational work.
It is good to teach/learn how a compiler works.
mips compiler is used because of simplicity, so you can better read assembly code
you can change mips_4KC-cpp with i686-pc-linux-gnu to compile to ia32


-preprocessor
mips_4KC-cpp -I. a.c -o a.i

-compiler
mips_4KC-gcc -S a.i -o a.s

-assemler
mips_4KC-as a.s -o a.o

linker
mips_4KC-ld a.o -o a /opt/eldk/mips_4KC/lib/crt1.o /opt/eldk/mips_4KC/lib/crti.o /opt/eldk/mips_4KC/lib/crtn.o --dynamic-linker /opt/eldk/mips_4KC/lib/ld.so.1 -lc
